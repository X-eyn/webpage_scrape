Help me create a code , that can permanently save any webpage on the internet along with all its media files present in that page . Basically , its like when we save a webpage as html for offline . Except this will work for any all and dynamic webpages/sites as well, (e.g.twitter). If i save a tweet post page , it will save everything and anything on that page (pics,vids,gifs, or anything ..literally anything without exception )
